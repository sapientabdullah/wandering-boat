# Wandering Boat

**Wandering Boat** is a 3D interactive experience built with Three.js, showcasing a boat drifting across a tranquil waterscape under a moonlit sky. The project features dynamic shaders, realistic water effects, and a serene lunar environment, with the boat gently floating across the surface as the user interacts with the scene.

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) – 3D graphics library for creating and rendering the scene.
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) – For smooth animations and interactions.
- [GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader) – For loading 3D models (e.g., the boat).
- [EffectComposer](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/postprocessing/EffectComposer) – For post-processing effects like bloom.
- [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) – For interactive camera controls.
